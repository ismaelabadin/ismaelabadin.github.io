            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>
                    I am a software engineer looking for opportunities as a Full-Stack Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, 
                    or in Cybersecurity. I will briefly touch on my backgrounds/interests in these three fields in the
                    following paragraphs. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UC Davis, and I completed my 
                    Master of Computer Science (remotely) at ASU, with specialization in Cybersecurity. Feel free to check out 
                    some of my projects below!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been making websites since I was in middle school, when I used to participate in National History Day.
                    Back then, I would use website builders such as Weebly to design and perfect my projects. During my undergrad
                    I pursued a different path, but since graduating I've come full-circle and have delved straight into becoming
                    a web developer. I have built many apps in React, and have received a Udemy certification in React. Relevant work 
                    experience includes my most recent position at Hunt Club, where I worked to improve candidate search functionality 
                    by utilizing Elasticsearch's many features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another field I have both passion and experience in is Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning
                    and Computer Vision. Beyond tasks such as object recognition and collision prediction, I am actually
                    interested in the intersection between web development and AI. Whether it is voice-based searches,
                    automatically tagging images, or fine-tuning chatbox service desks, the marriage between AI and web
                    development is not only one of the most interesting aspects of the field to me, but is also more impactful to
                    the general public compared to a self-driving car. In addition, I received certification from Stanford's
                    online Machine Learning course. Relevant work experience includes a previous position where I worked to develop
                    software to detect and classify damage from aerial photographs.

                <p>
                    Finally, (cyber)security is something very important to me. In fact, the entire premise of my personal
                    statement for my grad school application was built on my view of universal digital privacy as a human right,
                    and actually ties in nicely with AI. Whether we look at elections, self-driving cars, or storing sensitive
                    data, having secure networks is paramount to achieving digital safety. I believe the field of computer science
                    requires a culture shift away from stealing data from people and selling it, where every other day a new app
                    pops up that is just blatantly using pictures to train their AI algorithms (see: FaceApp), and towards a
                    culture where the right to privacy of consumers is respected, and their lives are amplified by our
                    technologyâ€”no hidden fees. Our generation has grown up with sophisticated technology, which has in turn
                    exploited our right to privacy. As a result, there is a growing movement demanding easy and secure access to
                    technology as a basic right, and ensuring the digital privacy of people everywhere is the first step towards
                    this vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a lighter note, I am an Arsenal, Bulls, Cubs, and Bears fan. For those of you who are not well-versed with
                    sports, just know that this means I am very patient and very, very loyal. I love to watch, play, and analyze
                    soccer, and that consumes the vast majority of my free time. I also enjoy hiking, cooking, and a nice suit.
